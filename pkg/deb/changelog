xcalar (1.4.0) stable; urgency=low
  * Xcalar 1.4 General Availability Release
    - New features:
      Workbooks:
        > Workbooks can now be downloaded and uploaded
        > Instead of a global library of UDFs shared by all users, UDFs now
        belong to a workbook or to a batch dataflow. Users will now only be
        able to modify UDFs that belong in their workbooks. Users will still
        be able to access UDFs from other workbooks, but they'll need to make
        a copy of it into their workbooks to use it or to make changes to it.
        This means that changes to UDFs will only affect the workbooks where
        the UDFs are residing. UDFs belonging to a batch dataflow is still
        globally editable by all users, but will only affect the batch
        dataflow
        > Jupyter notebooks are now local to a workbook
        > Multiple workbooks can be opened at once, and can be opened in
        different browser tabs
        > Play/Pause/Stop of workbooks removed. Workbooks are now opened or
        closed.

      Batch Dataflows:
        > Batch dataflows now use its own copy of UDFs instead of using the
        global library of UDFs. Dataflows' UDFs are globally editable by all
        users.
        > Parameters specified in the batch dataflow scheduling screen are now
        global and can be applied to all dataflows. Changes in parameters will
        only affect subsequent dataflows and doesn't affect dataflows already
        running / scheduled.
        > Advanced Parameterization mode added to batch dataflow screen.
        Advanced users can now modify the batch dataflow directly via the JSON
        editor.

      Licensing:
        > Updating of license no longer requires a cluster restart
        > License format changed from binary to key=value format.
        > Xcalar cluster is now disabled when running unlicensed.
        > License provided will determine the behavior of the cluster on
        expiration of the license: either the cluster will be disabled, or a
        warning will be periodically shown

      Operators:
        > Except and Intersect operators are now supported

    - Beta features:
      SQL Support:
        > 100% TPC-H queries coverage and 90% TPC-DS queries coverage
        > Users can now issue SQL in Xcalar Design during modeling to build
        out their dataflows. Dataflows, hence, can be built out with a
        combination of visual point-and-click, SQL and programming. SQL issued
        in Xcalar can invoke UDFs.

      JDBC:
        > SQL can also be issued to the Xcalar Cluster via JDBC (Spark SQL)

      Published tables:
        > Different class of tables from usual Xcalar Tables that are private
        and immutable -- published tables are mutable and global

    - Enhancements:
      > Column limit now increased to 1023 from 127.
      > Standard deviation / Variance now ignores NULL values
      > Azure AD integration improved: added support for Microsoft Common
      Endpoint v2.0, which is needed by multi-tenant Azure AD and Azure ADB2C.
      > A cluster can now be configured to run in latency-optimized mode,
      throughput-optimized mode, or mixed-mode.

    - Behavior change:
      > Use of Apache WebServer has been deprecated. Caddy is now the primary
      HTTP server.

    - Behavior change:
      > Descending sort now places FnFs at the bottom
      > Load targets can now be parametrized
      > Data target can now only be created and deleted by admins
      > streaming UDF is now available as User-Defined Format, instead of an action
