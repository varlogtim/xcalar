## Manylinux1 wheels for Apache Arrow

This folder provides base Docker images and an infrastructure to build
`manylinux1` compatible Python wheels that should be installable on all
Linux distributions published in last four years.

The process is split up in two parts: There are base Docker images that build
the native, Python-indenpendent dependencies. For these you can select if you
want to also build the dependencies used for the Parquet support. Depending on
these images, there is also a bash script that will build the pyarrow wheels
for all supported Python versions and place them in the `dist` folder.

### Build instructions

```bash
# Build the python packages
docker run --shm-size=2g --rm -t -i -v $PWD:/io -v $PWD/../../:/arrow quay.io/xhochy/arrow_manylinux1_x86_64_base:latest /io/build_arrow.sh
# Now the new packages are located in the dist/ folder
ls -l dist/
```

### Updating the build environment
The base docker image is less often updated. In the case we want to update
a dependency to a new version, we also need to adjust it. You can rebuild
this image using

```bash
docker build -t arrow_manylinux1_x86_64_base -f Dockerfile-x86_64_base .
```

For each dependency, we have a bash script in the directory `scripts/` that
downloads the sources, builds and installs them. At the end of each dependency
build the sources are removed again so that only the binary installation of a
dependency is persisted in the docker image. When you do local adjustments to
this image, you need to change the name of the docker image in the `docker run`
command.
