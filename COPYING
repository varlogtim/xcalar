This Agreement applies to each Release unless Xcalar provides other terms with the Release.  In case of a conflict between this Agreement and such other terms, the other terms will prevail.

2.2     Evaluation License.  If Xcalar has provided you with a copy of the Software solely for internal evaluation to determine whether you will purchase a license or subscription to the Software, Xcalar grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without right of sublicense, to internally use the Software, without modification, solely for evaluation purposes during the Evaluation Period (“Evaluation License”).  The “Evaluation Period” means the 30 days following the date you initially download the Software unless Xcalar agrees in writing to extend the period or otherwise to a longer Evaluation Period for a specified period of time.

Information concerning the inclusion of Open Source Software and Third Party Software, if any, and the notices, license terms, and disclaimers applicable to that software are generally contained in a corresponding license file identified with file names such as “notice,” “license,” “license.txt,” “readme,” “readme.txt,” or “copying”; you should contact Xcalar support if you cannot locate the Open Source Software or Third Party Software license for the Product.  If, in a notice file, Xcalar identifies code as “Modifiable Code”, Xcalar authorizes you to a) modify the Modifiable Code, and b) reverse engineer the Product modules that directly interface with the Modifiable Code, provided you do so only for the purpose of debugging your modifications to the Modifiable Code.  If the Open Source Software licenses include a license that provides for the availability of source code (e.g., the GNU General Public License) and the corresponding source code is not included with the Product, check Xcalar’s product support pages to learn how to obtain such source code.

2.5     Reservation of Rights.  The Product is licensed, not sold, by Xcalar to you under this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement will be interpreted or construed as a sale or purchase of the Product.

You may not share the keys with third parties.  You may not use any key that is assigned to a third party.  If this Agreement grants you an Evaluation License, your key or the Software may include disabling code, which may be used to disable the Software.  Xcalar may use such disabling code to ensure that you do not continue to use the Software longer than the term of your Evaluation License.  Upon the expiration of your Evaluation License, and if Xcalar has not granted you an extension, the Software may cease to function in some or all respects and you may lose access to data made with or stored using the Software.

3.3     Maintenance Services.  Xcalar will provide you with Maintenance Services for so long as you are current with your payment of the Maintenance Services subscription fees. Maintenance Services are provided under the following terms:

(a)          Xcalar will use reasonable efforts to correct (e.g., by providing a workaround or correction) verified Errors with a level of effort commensurate with the severity of the Error.  Xcalar is not, however, obligated to correct all Errors.

(b)          Within a reasonable time after general commercial publication, Xcalar will make available to you one copy of all Maintenance Releases and all corrections to the associated Documentation.  You may purchase Major Releases for an additional fee.

Xcalar will support a Release of the Software for a period of six months from the first production ship date of the Major Release that supersedes it or from the discontinuation date, as applicable.  Special support prices may apply for the support of outdated or discontinued Releases of the Software after the initial six-month period.

You will promptly implement all Releases, Error corrections, and workarounds provided by Xcalar.  You must supervise, control, and manage the use of the Software.  In addition, you are responsible for archiving your data to mitigate against losses that may be caused by Errors.  In order to provide Error corrections, workarounds, and Releases, Xcalar may require you to upgrade, at your own cost, your hardware and software systems to Xcalar’s then-current supported versions of system components. 

(g)          The provision of the Maintenance Services by Xcalar is contingent upon your performance of your obligations under this Agreement.  Xcalar reserves the right, in addition to other remedies that are available, to suspend its provision of the Maintenance Services for so long as you are not current with your obligations.

3.4     Support Services.  Xcalar will provide you with Support Services for so long as you are current with your payment of the Support Services subscription fees.  “Support Services” means Xcalar’s provision of telephone and email support consisting of (a) assistance related to questions on the operational use of the Software; (b) assistance with identifying and verifying causes of suspected Errors; and (c) providing workarounds for verified Errors when reasonably available to Xcalar.

7.        WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMER

7.1     Mutual Warranties.  Each party represents and warrants to the other that: (a) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered and constitutes a valid and binding agreement enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms; (b) no authorization or approval from any third party is required in connection with such party’s execution, delivery, or performance of this Agreement; and (c) the execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement does not violate the laws of any jurisdiction or the terms or conditions of any other agreement to which it is a party or by which it is otherwise bound.

7.2     Performance Warranty

(a)          Unless you have been granted an Evaluation License or a Beta License, Xcalar warrants to you that the Software will perform without Errors during the 90-day period following delivery to you of the license key to the Software (“Warranty Period”).  Software governed by an Evaluation License or a Beta License is provided “as is” and Xcalar does not warrant that the Software or Beta Software will operate without error or interruption.

(b)          If any portion of the Software fails to conform to the warranty in Section 7.2(a), your exclusive remedy, and Xcalar’s entire liability in contract, tort, or otherwise, will be to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide a correction or workaround for any Error that is (a) reported to Xcalar during the Warranty Period and (b) reproducible by Xcalar on an unmodified copy of the most current Release of the Software.  If after repeated efforts, Xcalar is unable to provide a correction or workaround for a reported Error, then your exclusive remedy, and Xcalar’s entire liability in contract, tort, or otherwise, will be to terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of all license fees paid by you for the Software upon your return of the original and all copies of the Software in your possession, together with your certification that you have ceased all use, reproduction, and distribution of the Software.

(c)          The warranty and remedies set forth in Sections 7.2(a)and 7.2(b) will not apply to the extent that a reported Error is caused in whole or in part by: (i) any defect in any portion of any third party software or hardware not furnished by Xcalar or not specified in the Documentation for use with the Software; (ii) any modification or enhancement made to the Software by anyone other than Xcalar; (iii) the failure of you to follow the most current instructions promulgated by Xcalar with respect to the proper use of the Software; (v) the negligence of you or any third party; or (vi) Unauthorized Use of the Software.  If Xcalar determines that any warranty claim reported by you falls within any of the foregoing exceptions, you will pay Xcalar for its services at Xcalar’s hourly rates then in effect.

7.3     Disclaimer.  EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES STATED IN THIS SECTION 7, Xcalar MAKES NO ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED (EITHER IN FACT OR BY OPERATION OF LAW), OR STATUTORY, AS TO ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER.  Xcalar EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR YOUR PURPOSE, QUALITY, ACCURACY, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  Xcalar DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE PRODUCT IS ERROR-FREE OR THAT OPERATION OF THE PRODUCT WILL BE SECURE OR UNINTERRUPTED. 

7.4     Risks of Using Beta Software.  Xcalar has not commercially released Beta Software, and Beta Software has not yet been tested like other commercially released software that you may use.  Therefore, it is likely that Beta Software will contain errors, including errors that may cause the Beta Software or your computer or device to malfunction or cause a loss of data.  If you do not wish to accept the risk of errors in the Beta Software, please do not install or use the Beta Software.  Furthermore, Xcalar is not obligated to correct errors, correct the effects of errors (e.g., fix your computer or recover lost data), or provide any technical support related to use of the Beta Software.

8.        INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT

8.1     Infringement Defense.  Xcalar will defend you from any actual or threatened third party claim that the Software infringes or misappropriates any U.S. patent issued as of the date you first accept this Agreement or any copyright or trade secret of any third party during the term of this Agreement if:  (a) you give Xcalar prompt written notice of the claim; (b) Xcalar has full and complete control over the defense and settlement of the claim; (c) you provides assistance in connection with the defense and settlement of the claim as Xcalar may reasonably request; and (d) you comply with any settlement or court order made in connection with the claim (e.g., relating to the future use of any infringing materials).

8.3     Mitigation of Infringement Action.  If your use of the Software is, or in Xcalar’s reasonable opinion is likely to become, enjoined or materially diminished as a result of a proceeding arising under Section 8.1, then Xcalar will either: (a) procure you the continuing right to use the Software; (b) replace or modify the Software in a functionally equivalent manner so that it no longer infringes; or if, despite its commercially reasonable efforts, Xcalar is unable to do either (a) or (b), Xcalar will (c) terminate the licenses with respect to the Software subject to the infringement claim and refund to you an amount equal to the depreciated license fees paid by you (calculated on a straight line basis over a three-year life).

8.4     Exclusions.  Xcalar will have no obligation under this Section 8 for any infringement to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon: (a) the combination, operation, or use of the Software with third party software or hardware not furnished by Xcalar or not specified in the Documentation for use with the Software if such infringement would have been avoided but for such combination, operation, or use; (b) use of the Software outside of the scope of the license granted to you; (d) your failure to use the latest Release of the Software or to comply with instructions provided by Xcalar, if the alleged infringement would not have occurred but for such failure; (e) any modification of the Software not made by Xcalar where such infringement would not have occurred absent such modification; or (f) Unauthorized Use of the Software.  You will reimburse Xcalar for any costs or damages that result from these actions.

8.5     Exclusive Remedy.  This Section 8 states Xcalar’s sole and exclusive liability, and your sole and exclusive remedy, for the actual or alleged infringement of any third party intellectual property right by the Software.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, Xcalar WILL NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS OR LOSS OF BUSINESS, EVEN IF Xcalar IS APPRISED OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES OCCURRING.

10.2  Cap on Liability.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL Xcalar’S TOTAL LIABILITY OF ALL KINDS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTY CLAIMS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY ACTION OR CLAIM IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO Xcalar UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (DETERMINED AS OF THE DATE OF ANY FINAL JUDGMENT IN AN ACTION).

10.3  Independent Allocations of Risk.  EACH PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS OF THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES.  THIS ALLOCATION IS REFLECTED IN THE PRICING OFFERED BY Xcalar TO YOU AND IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES.  EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10 WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT.

11.     GENERAL

11.1  Notices.  Any notice required or permitted to be given in accordance with this Agreement will be effective if it is in writing and sent by certified or registered mail, or insured courier, return receipt requested, to the appropriate party at the address set forth in your quote or order form and with the appropriate postage affixed.  Either party may change its address for receipt of notice by notice to the other party in accordance with this Section.  Notices are deemed given two business days following the date of mailing or one business day following delivery to a courier. 

11.2  Governing Law.  This Agreement will be interpreted, construed, and enforced in all respects in accordance with the local laws of the State of Utah, U.S.A without reference to its choice of law rules and not including the provisions of the 1980 U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.  Each party hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal, state, and local courts in Salt Lake County, Utah, in connection with any action arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.

11.3  Consent to Use of Data.  Xcalar may collect technical information relating to your use of the Product and Xcalar products. To the extent you select the applicable option when installing the Product, you grant Xcalar and its contractors a perpetual, irrevocable right to use and disclose non-identifiable information relating to your use of the Product, as long as any disclosed information does not include a key or other mechanism that would enable the information to be re-identified.

11.4  Assignability.  You may not assign your rights, duties, or obligations under this Agreement without Xcalar’s prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.  If consent is given, this Agreement will bind your successors and assigns.  Any attempt by you to transfer its rights, duties, or obligations under this Agreement except as expressly provided in this Agreement is void.  Xcalar may freely assign its rights, duties, or obligations under this Agreement without your prior written consent, including by operation of law or in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets.

11.5  Commencing Legal Action.  An action for breach of this Agreement or any other action otherwise arising out of this Agreement must be commenced within one year from the date the right, claim, demand, or cause of action first occurs or be barred forever.

11.6  Waiver.  The waiver by either party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement does not waive any other breach.  The failure of any party to insist on strict performance of any covenant or obligation in accordance with this Agreement will not be a waiver of such party’s right to demand strict compliance in the future, nor will the same be construed as a novation of this Agreement.

11.7  Severability.  If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision of this Agreement to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining portions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.  If any limitation or restriction on the grant of any license to you under this Agreement is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the license will immediately terminate.

11.8  Interpretation.  The parties have had an equal opportunity to participate in the drafting of this Agreement and the attached exhibits, if any.  No ambiguity will be construed against any party based upon a claim that that party drafted the ambiguous language.
