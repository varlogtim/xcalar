This is just a staging ground directory for initial work on XPU barriers.  Doing
a make in this directory builds the executable "xpuBarr" which when run, will
run a test on the barrier logic using an assumed set of send/recv interfaces.

Eventually, the c++ code/logic will land in UdfPyXcalar.cpp, and the send/recv
interfaces will be replaced by the final send/recv XPU <-> XPU interfaces.

And finally, the c++ code/logic will be re-written in python. The initial work
in C++ is just to get the logic working quickly with simulated send/recv
interfaces, and XPUs simulated as threads (each XPU = a pthread, with a XPUid
assigned to each thread).
