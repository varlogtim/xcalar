To build:
g++ shm.c -lrt

This experiment demonstrates the process and cgroup behavior in Linux memory accounting:
1) When you run this via ./a.out, the parent will mlock 1GB of shared memory, and fork 3 children
2) Each children will then touch every byte of the 1GB of shared memory.

When looking at /proc/<pid>/smaps, grep for testShm, and notice that RSS for each child is 1GB.

When you put the parent and children in different cgroups, you will see that parent cgroup
memory controller reports just over 1GB and the cgroup memory controller of the children is
just a few MB.

This validates "first-touch" memory accounting as documented by the cgroup memory controller
(Section 2.3 Shared Page Accounting) here:
