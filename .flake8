# E501: line too long (> 79 characters)
# E122: continuation line missing indentation or outdented
# E126: continuation line over-indented for hanging indent
# E129: visually indented line with same indent as next logical line
# W503: line break before binary operator
# W504: line break after binary operator
#   These all seem inevitable with yapf and aren't a major eyesore, so it makes
#   sense to allow them.
# F841: local variable is assigned to but never used
#   This seems like it could be useful, but we frequently use the local
#   variable name in order to make it clear what the return type of something
#   is, so for example, `table = client.execute_dataflow()` is useful even if
#   we don't do anything with table.
# E121 continuation line under-indented for hanging indent
